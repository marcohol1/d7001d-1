Ask a question like the following, you can change it as needed:

Write a Python script to update the following via a WordPress site

1. Change the last name to "secret last name".

2. Change the nickname to "secret nickname"

3. Change the email to "todd+" + a random four-digit number + "@ToddBooth.Com", for example, "todd+2378@ToddBooth.Com"

4. Change website to "https://Test.com"

Here is a bash script and please use the same variables and values when creating the Python script.

#!/bin/bash
username="put your username here"
api_key_1="put your api-key-1 here"
base_url="https://toddbooth.com/wp-json/wp/v2"

curl -X POST \
	-u "${username}:${api_key_1}" \
	"${base_url}/posts/" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{
		"title": "Just A Random Post Title",
		"content": "This is the content of the new post.",
		"status": "publish"
	}'

Then create a Python script based on the the Chat output, debug it, get it working, and then save the file as "lab-11-a.py".

Then write a brand new Python script to get a list of the WordPress users, loop through the users, and print only the username.  Save the file as "lab-11-b.py".

Then write a brand new Python script, to loop through all users, and update all users, as in "lab-11-a.py".  Save the file as "lab-11-c.py".

Good Luck, Teacher Todd
